\begin{quote}
	Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world. ~A Cypherpunk's Manifesto by Eric Hughes, 1993

Re: 185.129.62.62 blocked at XXX

Very sorry,

This IP is in use for Tor exit router. The IP is a Tor node relay, and
we have no further data regarding sessions. The Tor network by design
limits data and your can read more about Tor at: https://www.torproject.org/

Unfortunately the software is hardened against de-masking users and we cannot
help. We are of course sorry when the network is abused, but Tor is helping
a lot of people around the world to communicate more securely. We consider
the benefits from Tor greater than occasional abuse and hope you understand.

If problem persist we can filter out selected ranges from our server.
Mvh/Best regards
Henrik

\begin{quote}
Officers use counter-terrorism laws to remove a mobile phone from any passenger they wish coming through UK air, sea and international rail ports and then scour their data.

The blanket power is so broad they do not even have to show reasonable suspicion for seizing the device and can retain the information for "as long as is necessary".

Data can include call history, contact books, photos and who the person is texting or emailing, although not the contents of messages.
