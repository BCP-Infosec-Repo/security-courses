\begin{list2}
\item Master in computer science from University of Copenhagen
\item Got interested in internet security around early 1990s reading the Morris Internet worm analysis
\item Began reading a lot, there was no IT-security education except a bit of cryptography
\item Today white-hat hacker, pentester, security consultant, internet samurai
\item Teach a lot - 2019 Diploma in IT-Security KEA Kompetence, starts february
\item Keywords: network and security, internet technologies, network packets, BGP
\item {\bf We need more people in IT-security}
\end{list2}

\slide{Internet Security a Short Story}

\begin{list1}
\item Early internet before 1980 - Universities, mail was the popular \emph{app}
\item TCP/IP 1980s - got IP/TCP around 1983
\item Systems were big servers VAXEN
\item Around 60.000s servers connected on the internet by 1988
\item Security was not a high priority, research and development
\begin{list2}
\item Cuckoo's Egg 1986
\item Morris Internet Worm, On the evening of 2 November 1988\\
\emph{The Internet Worm Program: An Analysis}\\

\slide{Morris Internet Worm - 30 years ago}

\begin{list1}
\item Used multiple vulnerabilities:
\begin{list2}
\item Sendmail Debug functionality, we have similar things and Google Hacking
\item Buffer overflow in fingerd, we still have those
\item Weak passwords/password cracking, list of 432 words and /usr/dict/words, same problem today
\item Trust between systems rsh, rexec, think Domain Admin today
\item Found new systems using /etc/hosts.equiv, .rhosts, .forward, netstat ...
\end{list2}
\item Also known as the Morris Internet Worm
\item \emph{The Internet Worm Program: An Analysis}\\
Purdue Technical Report CSD-TR-823, Eugene H. Spafford
\item Resulted in creation of the CERT, \link{http://www.cert.org}
\end{list1}

\slide{Internet Worms history repeats itself}

\begin{list1}
\item Camouflage, tried to hide, malware today hides as well
\begin{list2}
\item Program name set to 'sh', looks like a regular shell
\item Used fork() to change process ID (PID)
\item Worms in the 2000s spread quickly, like Code Red 2001 to approx 350.000 systems in a week
\item SQL Slammer "It spread rapidly, infecting most of its 75,000 victims within ten minutes."
\end{list2}
\vskip 1cm
\item New malware today can use the same strategies
\item Except a lot of malware tries to stay hidden, less noisy
\item Using a small password list of 50 words it is possible to create your own botnet with 100.000s
\end{list1}
