# Email Security - domains, clients and servers

This presentation will be focused on email security overall - from domains to clients to servers. The presentation will include a lot of acronyms and some technical details, the goal though is to get an overview of available technologies and their benefits.

We will talk about domains and the current internet standards and recommendations for setting DNS records and features to optimise the reception of email securely - using encryption and certificates. Also which DNS records and features will prevent your domains from being abused for sending fake emails such as phishing with you as the sender.

We will discuss client features which are considered dangerous, loading images automatically etc. and how to improve your client security by using only specific protocols with encryption.

Servers will be discussed as examples of email architectures. Common blueprints for email will be discussed including which components are to be used for getting insights into your email security - reporting functions. Example open source software will be shown.

The goal for this presentation is for participants to get an overview of current email security, to allow them to evaluate their own posture - and plan a strategy to improve email security, both personally and professionally.
