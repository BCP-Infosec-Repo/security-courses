## Pentesting Networks Basics

A red team introduction to penetration testing in networks. We will start from
port scanning which is the fundamental part of any pentesting activity. Then
we will discuss issues found in many networks today.

* Insecure infrastructure - example network devices with admin/admin and SNMP
* Insecure default passwords - how to brute-force
* Detecting authentication and security settings, example SMB, SSH, TLS
* Get started hacking web sites using Burp, only introduction

Goal for this is to inspire and kick-start and interest into pentesting tools.
This will enable participants to scan their own networks efficiently. We will
go into some network packets in detail, but afterwards there are few
requirements for running the tools in your networks.

The goal for this presentation is for participants to get an overview of
pentesting in networks, to allow them to evaluate their own security level
- and plan a strategy to improve security, both personally and professionally.

The presentation will contain excerpts from my  penetration testing 5 ECTS course, which is open source.

Target audience, anyone interested in network security.

About equipment
Bringing a laptop is not required, but welcome. Exercises booklet
will be referenced, but it is expected that participants will do exercises
on their own later or at the scheduled hacker days.

The hacker days will be announced in the event calendar and also take
place during BornHack in the network warrior village.
